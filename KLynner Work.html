    <p>&nbsp;I started work the same way many do, in retail. It makes for excellent lessons in sympathy, empathy, and patience <br>
    The shift to assistance and safety for children at an indoor theme park added to those</p>lls. Though interrupted by COVID-19, My current job of teaching piano has been the best.
    The skills gained in customer service are a great help in knowing how to assist people, especially children, who struggle with learning the instrument.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <p>&nbsp; I look forward to editing alongside teaching piano once I graduate and my career can start properly.</p>
